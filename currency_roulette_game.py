# correct if the guessed value is between the interval surrounding the correct answer
#
# Properties
# 1. Difficulty
# Methods
# 1. get_money_interval -Will get the current currency rate from USD to ILS and will
# generate an interval as follows:
# a. for given difficulty d, and total value of money t the interval will be: (t - (5 - d), t +
# (5 - d))
#
# 2. get_guess_from_user - A method to prompt a guess from the user to enter a guess of
